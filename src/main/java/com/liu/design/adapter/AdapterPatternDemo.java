 * his pattern involves a single class which is responsible to join functionalities of independent or incompatible
 * interfaces. A real life example could be a case of card reader which acts as an adapter between memory card and a
 * laptop. You plugin the memory card into card reader and card reader into the laptop so that memory card can be read
 * via laptop.

 * only and wants to use an advanced audio player capable of playing vlc and mp4 files.
